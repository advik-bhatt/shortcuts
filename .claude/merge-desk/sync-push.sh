# merge-desk sync-push, v1.0.0
# The one sanctioned way for a Claude thread to push work to a shared repo.
#
# Master copy:   knowledge-base/global/merge-desk/sync-push.sh
# Vendored copy: <repo>/.claude/merge-desk/sync-push.sh  (same content, so a
#                thread that only cloned one repo still has the protocol)
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. refuses a dirty tree (commit first; untracked files are fine)
#   2. turns on git rerere, and the mergiraf structural merge driver when the
#      binary is installed, so trivial conflicts resolve themselves
#   3. fetch, rebase onto origin/main, push. Retries the race against other
#      threads up to 5 times with backoff.
#   4. on a real content conflict: captures both sides' commits and the
#      conflicted hunks, writes a conflict-card skeleton, aborts the rebase
#      (tree left exactly as before), and exits 42 so the thread follows the
#      merge-desk skill: resolve intent-first, re-push, file the card.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  pushed, or nothing to push
#   3  dirty tree, commit first
#   4  push kept failing (network or persistent rejection)
#   5  target branch refused by this environment; work pushed to the current
#      side branch instead, fold-to-main card owed
#   42 conflict captured, card skeleton written, thread must resolve

MERGE-DESK CONFLICT: two threads changed the same code in $REPO_NAME.
The rebase was aborted; your work is intact and unpushed.

Protocol for you (the Claude thread) - follow the merge-desk skill:
 1. Read $CARD and $META.
 2. Re-run: git rebase $REMOTE/$TARGET
    Resolve each file INTENT-FIRST: read both sides' commit messages and
    surrounding code, keep BOTH intents when possible. Never blind-pick
    ours/theirs. Then: git add <files> && git rebase --continue
 3. If .claude/merge-desk/strict-paths exists and matches any conflicted
    file: DO NOT push. Post the card as 'awaiting-approval' and stop.
 4. Otherwise re-run this script to push, then post the conflict card as a
    GitHub issue (title prefix [merge-desk], mode: auto-resolved) so the
    founder can review, reply, or revert. Use the card template in the
    merge-desk skill.
